## Analysis 
Sung Hea, my copartner, is working on hotel statistics from pre-covid. 

Trends noticed throughout all graphs:

Downtown Toronto has the most revenue and sales for hotels for 2022 and 2023. 

The amount of sales and revenues from hotels increase as each month passes. 

Most hotel sales come from the months of June, July and August. 

## Limitations

Data is limited to February to September 2023 and 2022. 

Data specifically from Statisitcs Canada and Ontario Canada.

Mainly coming from government databases. 

Could not find a proper API with hotel statistics, data sources availale online are limited.
