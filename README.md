# Ontario Travel Project 1

## Description of the Project 

This project talks about 
1. Traveler Profile : Who is traveling, what is their average income, the reason for their travel, are they traveling alone or with family? etc 
2. Inbound airline traffic comparison at Toronto Pearson (YYZ)
3. Restaurant Gross Revenue Comparison 

The analysis we're going to do is .. 
1. Total yearly inbound flights at Toronto Pearson from 2018-2023
2. Restaurant average check by area, comparing tourist and non-tourist performance
3. Hotel/Vacation Rentals Occupancies from 2018-2023
4. Traveler changes from Pre-COVID & Post-COVID

The questions we're going to answer are: 
1. How do inbound flights post-COVID compare to pre-COVID? 
2. How does overall restaurant revenues post-COVID compare to pre-COVID? 
3. How has the traveler changed post-COVID?
